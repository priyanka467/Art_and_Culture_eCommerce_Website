      <p>Sikki craft is found in the states of Bihar, especially in the northern region, and in the Tarai regions of Uttar Pradesh. The grass is also used in other crafts, such as papier mache, sujani embroidery, and appliqué works</p>
<p>Sikki is a natural fiber found near the banks of rivers in the Koshi region of Madhubani district. Sikki grass is first cut from near the root and washed with water. Sikki flower is not used. The rest of the grass is cut and then shaved with a knife. The Sikki made after this are mixed with different colors and crafts are made. This grass does not have a high potency so Munj grass is used as a strength provider. Sikki crafts are various handicrafts which represent a unique culture of a particular region. It includes economic as well as traditional values. Sikki handicrafts also produce decorative and unique items along with items used in daily life. This art field is a source of income for many artists. Presently, Raiyam village in Jhanjharpur block of Madhubani district and Rampur village in Panadol block are famous for this art. Artists in Raiyam weave from Sikki grass and prepare various items. In Rampur, painting is done by cutting and pasting Sikki, which is a unique gift for art lovers. Currently UpendraMaharathi Crafts Research Institute is striving for the upliftment of this art and artists.</p>
      <p>Dhirendra Kumar of Rampur (Madhubani) has recently started to use Sikki grass to create unique paintings. He uses a surgical blade to peel and thin the first stem of the grass, then uses favibonds to sketch photographs of hardboard deities and legends, and then pastes the stalks of Sikki to give the desired shape.</p>
